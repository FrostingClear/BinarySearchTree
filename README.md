SCREENSHOTS OF THE RUNNING APPLICATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE FUNCTIONALITY SCREENSHOTS FOLDER

--------
This is an example of a Binary Search Tree, that I did for a class assignment.

Using a generated dataset of names and ages, three trees are created (sorted by first name, last name, age)

You are able to switch between them and search through them using different algorithms.

You can traverse the trees using different algorithms, check the balance of the tree, re-balance it, auto-balance it and add random people / remove 
people.

The dataset is generated based on a list of names, it grabs one of the first names on the list and combines it with one of the last names on the last.
